    Author: LAB
    Type: Standard
    Status: Draft
    Created: 2017-12-14

## Simplified Summary

A standard interface for perishable asset tokens.

## Abstract

This standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for perishable asset tokens (henceforth referred to as "PAT") within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer ownership of PATs.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows any PATs on Ethereum to be handled by general-purpose applications. In particular, it will allow for PATs to be tracked in standardized wallets and traded on exchanges.

## Specification

### ERC-721 Compatibility


## Implementation

_Reference implementation forthcoming..._
